# e-commerce-website-
An e-commerce website like amazon though I have not added payment methods but It is a great project for beginner 

To run this you need to have python in your system, then you can run following commands on cmd/Terminal: 
1. pip install django
2. pip install django-filter #(for search options)
3. pip install pillow #(for images(profile pictures))

Happy coding!      

bugs and modifications are highly appreciated!

NOTE: This is not my own project,I have followed a course.
